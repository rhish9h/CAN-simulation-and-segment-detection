# CAN Simulation and Segment Detection

- Java program for real-time simulation and replay of sensor values and GPS coordinates from CAN bus data and GPS files, ensuring accurate timing representation.
- Analysis of sensor data, segmentation of the test drive route into straight and curve segments, and derivation of useful information like average speeds to improve driver awareness.
